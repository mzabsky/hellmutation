/// A class that allows menus to receive events from elements in the element
/// tree.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// All methods in a handler receive at least two things - the thing that is sending the event, and
/// a `command` string that allows for more conveniently identifying what purpose the event was
/// sent for. Some events give more information, but at least these will be present on every
/// method.

	///
	/// `variable` contains the new state of the set of radio buttons to avoid having to fetch it
	/// from the caller.
